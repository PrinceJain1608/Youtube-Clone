        This HTML CSS full course is a series of HTML CSS tutorials, teaching the major skills that we need to create complex websites. Each HTML CSS tutorial builds on a project and provides some HTML CSS exercises to practice what we learned. By the end, we'll learn the basics of web development and we'll be on our way to becoming a web developer and software engineer.
